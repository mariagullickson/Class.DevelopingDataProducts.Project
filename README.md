# Developing Data Products course project

For this project, I developed a Shiny App that will tell a parent (or other interested individual) how their baby is doing compared to standard growth charts.  Users enter the childs gender, age, weight, height and head circumference and the app tells them what percentile the child is in for weight height and head circumference.  This information is computed using data from the CDC available [here](http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/percentile_data_files.htm).

The application can be found in the app subdirectory.  The presentation subdirectory contains a slidify presentation pitching the app.
