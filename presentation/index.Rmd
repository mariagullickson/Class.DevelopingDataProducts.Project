## What's the problem?

- You want to know if your baby's growth is on track.
- You may not always get this information from your pediatrician.
- You want to know how your baby is doing between visits to the pediatrician.

---

## What is the best way to check your baby's growth?
```{r unitconversion, echo=FALSE}
lb <- 12.2
kilogramsPerPound <- 0.453592
kg <- round(lb * kilogramsPerPound, 1)
```

- Baby books have charts, but they can be a pain to use.
- The [***Infant and Toddler Growth Percentile***](https://mariagullickson.shinyapps.io/project/) tool does all the work for you.
- It can even handle multiple units, so you can enter your baby's weight as `r lb` pounds or as `r kg` kilograms, for example.

---

## How do I use the tool?

- First enter your baby's gender and age.
- Then enter your baby's measurements - weight, height and head circumference.
- If you don't know them all, simply enter the ones you know.
- Hit submit.
- Your baby's percentile as compared to other babies of the same age and gender will be presented to the right.

_Note: percentiles are based on data in the United States.  Percentiles will vary in other countries._
